## Atreya Tadepalli
I am a data science graduate student at Duke interested in applying machine learning to model and analyze market, financial, and technological risks to ultimately inform business strategy. Previously, I studied economics and politics and worked in economic consulting for three years, conducting financial risk analysis and valuation modeling.

Below are the projects I have worked on - topics range from natural language processing to detect fake information, to financial risk modeling, to application development.
